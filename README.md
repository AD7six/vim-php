Vim Php
=======

Vim settings for php developers.

Php documentor (PDV) and some generic php settings.

This vim plugin is based on the work of Tobias Schlitt with pdv and vip.

# Installation

I recommend using [Vim Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

Therefore:

    cd .vim/bundles
    git clone git://github.com/AD7six/vim-php.git

Alternatively - simply put the file independence.vim in your plugin folder directly
